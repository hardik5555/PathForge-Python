#Pathfinding Algorithm for Shortest Path Detection

This project demonstrates a pathfinding algorithm implemented in Python, designed to trace the shortest and easiest paths on a grid with obstacles. It's built for applications in the gaming sector, where efficient pathfinding is essential for gameplay, navigation, and AI behavior.

Key Features
*Grid-Based Navigation: The algorithm works on a grid system, marking the start and end points, as well as obstacles.

*Shortest Path Calculation: Uses pathfinding algorithms (like A* or Dijkstra’s) to determine the shortest route from the start to the destination, avoiding obstacles.

*Real-Time Visualization: Displays the algorithm's progress, highlighting explored paths and the final shortest path.

*Versatile for Games: Optimized for integration into games, enhancing character movement, AI routing, and map traversal.
